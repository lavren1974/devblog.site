Here is my modification guide for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) ã€‚

At the same time, [Docusaurus 3.0](https://docusaurus.io/zh-CN/blog/releases/3.0) was officially released, and the dependencies were upgraded and the project was refactored to make it easier to understand and use.

You are also welcome to use this theme. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/kuizuo/blog/discussions) propose.
